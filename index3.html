Before coming back to programming I still had the organizational bug!
I would spend my free time making planners as well as the paper trail that followed.. Once i started taking classes with <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">boot.dev</a>, I decided take my little hobby and turn it into a project. I must add that my mother was a big inspiration for the project, since she was having a lot of events to juggle and I wanted to help her get a look at her schedule. <b>The planner I created provides a daily schedule, a look at tomorrows schedule, a look at what's coming up this week, and all events scheduled provided the date exists in roughly 900 years.</b></blockquote><h2>Introduction</h2><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
