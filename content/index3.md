> The Planner is my version of never missing an appointment. Before coming back to programming I still had the organizational bug!
> I would spend my free time making planners as well as the paper trail that followed.. Once i started taking classes with [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/), I decided take my little hobby and turn it into a project. I must add that my mother was a big inspiration for the project, since she was having a lot of events to juggle and I wanted to help her get a look at her schedule. **The planner I created provides a daily schedule, a look at tomorrows schedule, a look at what's coming up this week, and all events scheduled provided the date exists in roughly 900 years.**
